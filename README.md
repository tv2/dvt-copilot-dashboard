# Introduction

The GitHub Copilot Metrics Dashboard is a solution accelerator designed to visualize metrics from GitHub Copilot using the [GitHub Copilot Metrics API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-usage?apiVersion=2022-11-28) and [GitHub Copilot User Management API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/copilot/copilot-user-management?apiVersion=2022-11-28).

The dashboard showcases a range of features:

**Filters:**
Ability to filter metrics by date range, languages, code editors and visualise data by time frame (daily, weekly, monthly).

**Acceptance Average:** Percentage of suggestions accepted by users for given date range and group by time range (daily, weekly, monthly).

**Active Users:** Number of active users for the last cycle.

**Adoption Rate:** Number of active users who are using GitHub Copilot in relation to the total number of licensed users.

**Seat Information:** Number of active, inactive, and total users.

**Language:** Breakdown of languages which can be used to filter the data.

**Code Editors:** Breakdown of code editors which can be used to filter the data.

# Deploy to Azure

## DVT-specific setup

You need access to the `Developer tooling prod-001` subscription in Azure. To do this, log into Azure with your adm account, navigate to [`Privileged Identity Management > My roles > Groups`](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_PIMCommon/ActivationMenuBlade/~/aadgroup) and activate the `az-sub-Developer Tooling-prod-001-owner` group for the time you need.

Run:

```sh
azd auth login
# choose your adm account in the browser window that pops up
azd init
# set environment name = dvt-copilot-dashboard
azd up
# choose
#   subscription = Developer Tooling- prod- 001 subscription
#   location = (Europe) West Europe (westeurope)
#   githubAPIScope = organization
#   githubEnterpriseName = tv2
#   githubOrganisationName = tv2
```

We haven't figured out how to attach to the existing secrets :shrug:

## General setup

The solution accelerator is a web application that uses Azure App Service, Azure Functions, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure Storage and Azure Key Vault. The deployment template will automatically populate the required environment variables in Azure Key Vault and configure the application settings in Azure App Service and Azure Functions.
![GitHub Copilot Metrics - Architecture ](/docs/CopilotDashboard.png "GitHub Copilot Metrics - Architecture")

The following steps will automatically provision Azure resources and deploy the solution accelerator to Azure App Service and Azure Functions using the Azure Developer CLI.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ You must setup [authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview-authentication-authorization) using the built-in authentication and authorization capabilities of Azure App Service.

#### Prerequisites

You will be prompted to provide the following information:

```
- GitHub Enterprise name
- GitHub Organization name
- GitHub Token
- GitHub API Scope
```

GitHub API Scope define the GITHUB_API_SCOPE environment variable that can be "enterprise" or "organization". It is used to define at which level the GitHub APIs will gather data. If not specified, the default value is "organization".

1. Download the [Azure Developer CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/overview)
1. If you have not cloned this repo, run `azd init -t microsoft/copilot-metrics-dashboard`. If you have cloned this repo, just run 'azd init' from the repo root directory.
1. Run `azd up` to provision and deploy the application

```pwsh
azd init -t microsoft/copilot-metrics-dashboard
azd up

# if you are wanting to see logs run with debug flag
azd up --debug
```
